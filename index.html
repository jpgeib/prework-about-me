      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am learning how to code in order to get 
        a job that actually puts money on the table. 
        If only creative writing, music, and other beloved art forms 
        were less risky and more financially stable career paths...</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Milford, CT. The town where if you were 
        expecting more than a Westfield Mall Center... 
        I'm so sorry, let me reimburse your travel expenses.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Writing, Gaming, Music, Exercise/Gym, basically anything that
        is only marketable/financially stable under the right circumstances
        accompanied by good ol' fashioned dumb luck.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>TV Staff Writer or Executive Producer, but because those
        career paths are very hit or miss, I'm turning to coding careers
        in order to have finances to fall back on in the scenario that 
        LA/Hollywood chews me up and spits me out.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Oakland, CA. What? Were you expecting another sarcastic quip?
        I don't have snarky remarks for everything, you know.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>As previously stated, to obtain marketable skills and be able
        to achieve financial stability. Plus, I was always interested in
        coding, but never found the time to pursue learning it until now.
        Totally not because I realized a lot of the skills I developed in
        college weren't as financially sound or anything... Okay, yes it was
        because of that, but nevertheless, I still enjoy coding and wish
        to make a career out of it.</p>
